# Text Calculator (DataSummarizer)

This repository contains a TDD-driven implementation of the String Calculator kata,
implemented under the class `DataSummarizer` with the method `DataSummarizer.aggregate(series)`.

## Goals

- Follow TDD: write a failing test, make it pass, then refactor.

- Provide clear commit messages and a README.

## How to run tests

```bash
# ensure rspec is installed
gem install rspec

# run the specs
rspec
